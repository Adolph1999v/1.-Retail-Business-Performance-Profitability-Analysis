# Superstore Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from a large retail superstore to uncover trends, identify top-performing products and categories, and understand regional performance. The goal is to provide insights that can help optimize inventory, improve marketing strategies, and support data-driven business decisions.

The analysis combines **SQL, Python, and Tableau** to clean, transform, and visualize the data, creating interactive dashboards that highlight key sales patterns.

## Tools Used
- **SQL (MySQL/DBeaver):** For data import, cleaning, and aggregation into summary tables  
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn):** For data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and deriving additional metrics  
- **Tableau:** For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards

- **Python Notebooks:** Data cleaning, transformation, and preliminary analysis  
- **Tableau Dashboard:** Interactive visualizations including:  
  - Top 20 products by sales  
  - Category and sub-category sales by region  
  - Sales distribution by city (USA map)  
- **Cleaned CSV Files:** Prepared datasets ready for visualization

## Key Insights
- The **East region** leads overall sales, followed by West, Central, and South.  
- **Office Supplies** and **Technology** dominate the product mix, while Furniture lags behind.  
- Top-performing sub-categories include **Phones**, **Chairs**, **Storage**, and **Binders**.  
- Sales concentrate in major coastal metropolitan areas, with lower performance in the South.  
- The Top 20 products reinforce that Technology and Office Supplies drive the majority of sales.

## Recommendations
- Focus marketing and inventory efforts on top-performing regions and products.  
- Prepare for seasonal peaks in sales, especially in high-performing categories.  
- Explore growth opportunities in underperforming regions, particularly the South.  
- Monitor low-performing categories for potential improvements or targeted campaigns.
